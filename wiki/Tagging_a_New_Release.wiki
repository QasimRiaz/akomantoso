#summary How to Tag and add new Akoma Ntoso release into the release repository

= Introduction =

New Akoma Ntoso releases are tagged with their release date and checked-into the release repository (see [http://akomantoso.googlecode.com/svn/release/tags/ list of releases]).

*NB:* Replace every instance of YYYY-MM-DD with the release date.


== Preparing the release folder ==

Unzip the release`*`.zip files, the hierarchy should be similar to this:
{{{
Release YYYYMMDD/
├── gpl-3.0.txt
├── release_notes/
├── schemas/
└── styles/
}}}

== Create and tag the new release in the repository ==

{{{
svn mkdir https://akomantoso.googlecode.com/svn/release/tags/release-YYYY-MM-DD --username your@email.address
}}}

== Checkout and commit the new release ==

Checkout from the newly created tag above:

{{{
svn co https://akomantoso.googlecode.com/svn/release/tags/release-YYYY-MM-DD --username your@email.address
}}}

This will create a folder release-YYYY-MM-DD. Copy the contents your unzipped above into release-YYYY-MM-DD:
{{{
cp /path/to/Release YYYYMMDD/* release-YYYY-MM-DD/
}}}

Then change directory into the release-YYYY-MM-DD, add the contents and checkin to the repository as shown below in three steps:
{{{
cd release-YYYY-MM-DD

svn add *

svn commit -m "Tagging YYYY-MM-DD release" --username your@email.address
}}}

*NB:* You will be prompted for a password which you can retrieve from here https://code.google.com/hosting/settings when you are logged into your google account.
