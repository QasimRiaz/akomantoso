#summary How to install the norma africa virtual machines for client and server

= Introduction =

This page documents the setting up activities for Norma server and the Norma virtual machines.

== Installing VMware workstation == 

*Pre-requisities* - a build environment. You can install the ubuntu build-essential package, by running the following in a terminal window :
{{{
sudo apt-get install build-essential
}}}

 * Open a terminal window, and extract the vmware workstation archive (`tar xvf vmware*.tar.gz`)
 * Change directory to the extracted vmware folder
 * Run the vmware installer :
{{{ 
sudo vmware-install.pl
}}}
 * Use the default settings to install vmware

== Configuring VMware == 

 * After the installation has finished, configure the vmware installation using the command:
{{{ 
sudo vmware-config.pl
}}}

 * Use the default suggestions, say "Yes" to both "Bridged networking" and "NAT networking".  Say "No" for "Host networking".

 * The configurator will compile the required drivers, and finish.

== Running the NormaServer virtual machine for the first time == 

 * Extract the compressed virtual machine archive. The archive uses 7zip. To install 7zip use the following command :
{{{
sudo apt-get install p7zip-full
}}}
 * After this you can extract the virtual machine from the archive using the command :
{{{
7z -e <7zip-archive-file-name-of-virtual-machine>
}}}
 * Launch vmware workstation, go to File->Open and browse to the folder with the extracted virtual machine.
