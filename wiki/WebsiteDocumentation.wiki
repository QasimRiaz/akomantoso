#summary This page details how to use the scripts in /svn/scripts to generate the documentation on the akomantoso.org website

= Generate the documentation for the site =

To generate the documentation, open akomantoso.xsd in Oxygen. Currently Oxygen 11 is supported. Go to Tools -> Generate Documentation -> Schema Documentation. 

In the dialog box that appears select HTML as the output format, and specify the output file name. Deselect the option to split the output into multiple files.

Next checkout the files
{{{
svn co http://akomantoso.googlecode.com/svn/scripts/trunk akoma-scripts
}}}

There will be two files step_one.php and step_two.php and should be executed in order.

Step one renames all the links in the file and generates a CSV that is required by Plone. The required arguments are
 * The input file -> this is the file generated by Oxygen
 * The output files -> the new file with the modified links and the CSV that is to be uploaded on Plone.

{{{
./akoma-scripts/step_one.php akomantoso20.html newakoma.html newakoma.csv
}}}

Step two splits up the file and places the files in a docs folder in the current directory. The docs directory must exist before running step_two.

{{{
mkdir docs
./akoma-scripts/step_two.php newakoma.html
}}}

Move the img folder to the docs folder
{{{
mv img docs/img
}}}
