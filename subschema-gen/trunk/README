Aknssg: the AKoma Ntoso SubSchema Generator
===========================================

Aknssg is an XProc-based application for the generation of subschemas
of Akoma Ntoso.

It is composed of two parts: a standalone generator of subschemas and
a web-based frontend.

Setup
-----
Run the provided install.sh script to deploy the system.

install.sh takes 2 parameters :

install.sh <param 1> <param 2>

param 1 = the path to which you want to deploy to, this can be an absolute path or a relative path

param 2 = web server prefix. if you are deploying as http://domain.com/webprefix/ then set this as /webprefix
if you are deploying directly under a domain e.g. http://domain.com , dont set param 2.

Installation
------------

The standalone generator does not require installation. It can be run
by launching the script `scripts/generate` with the appropriate
parameters.

The web-based frontend must be installed on a web server that supports
PHP5, Apache's .htaccess rewrite rules (Apache 2.2.x is suggested) and
Java 6.

The `deploy` script can be used to install the web-based frontend on
a new web server. It expects the following directory layout:

    Root directory
      └ cgi-bin/
      └ html/
      └ data/
        └ tmp/

The `cgi-bin` directory will hold all the executable PHP files, the
`html` directory will contain the static files and the `data` directory
will be used to store generated files and temporary files.

To install the frontend in the `/srv/web` directory run

    ./scripts/deploy /srv/web/

Once the frontend files have been deployed, the frontend must be
configured. To configure the frontend open the file
`/srv/web/cgi-bin/aknssg/aknssg-conf.php` and make the
`$root_dir_path` variable point to `/srv/web/data/aknssg`.

The last installation step is the addition of the URI rewrite rules.
The rules contained in the file `web/html/htaccess` must be copied to
an `.htaccess` file recognized by the web server.
